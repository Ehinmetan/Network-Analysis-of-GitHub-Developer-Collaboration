# Introduction

Collaboration serves as the foundation of open-source development, and social networks play a crucial role in connecting developers, facilitating knowledge-sharing, and fostering innovation. GitHub, one of the largest platforms for software development, provides a unique opportunity to study these interactions through its vast
network of contributors.
This report focuses on the GitHub Social Network dataset, which provides a detailed representation of interactions among developers who contribute to the same repositories. The analysis aims to identify key influencers, understand
collaboration patterns, and highlight areas of backend specialization in open-source projects.

# Objectives

- To examine the structure of the GitHub developer network

- Understand Developer Collaboration Patterns

- Identify the Most Connected Developers Using Degree Centrality

- Identify Key Bridge Developers Using Betweenness Centrality

- Analyze the Roles of AI-Assisted vs. Non-AI Developers in the Network:

- Investigate Collaboration Density and Its Implications

# Dataset Overview

### Source

 - Dataset: GitHub Social Network Dataset from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection
### Datasets Used:
- musae_git_edges.csv: This file contains the edges (connections) between developers who collaborated on GitHub.
Each edge represents a collaborative interaction between two developers, forming the basis of the network graph.
- musae_git_target.csv: This file provides developer attributes, specifically identifying whether a developer is focused
on machine learning (ml_target = 1) or web development (ml_target = 0). These attributes help categorize
developers based on their area of specialization.
# Dataset Structure
### musae_git_edges.csv:
- developer_id_1: The ID of the first developer in the interaction.

- developer_id_2: The ID of the second developer in the interaction.
  
- weight: The weight of the interaction, indicating the strength or frequency of the collaboration between the
developers.
### musae_git_target.csv:
- developer_id: The unique identifier for each developer.
  
- ml_target: A binary attribute that categorizes each developer as a machine learning (ml_target = 1) or web developer
(ml_target = 0).

## Network Structure

- Nodes (Developers): Represents the total number of developers in the network, with each node symbolizing an
individual developer.

- Edges (Connections): Represents the total number of interactions or collaborations between developers, where each
edge signifies a connection between two developers.

- Graph Type (Undirected): Indicates that the network is undirected, meaning the relationships between developers
are mutual, with no specific direction of interaction (e.g., both developers are considered as collaborators).

# Methodology

- Data Preprocessing: Checked for duplicates, handled missing values, and ensured data consistency for analysis.
### Tools Used
- Python was used for analysis with the following libraries:
- Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- NetworkX: Network analysis and centrality calculations.
- Matplotlib: Visualization of network graphs.
- NumPy: Numerical computations.
- Random: Data simulation.
- Collections (Counter): Frequency-based analysis.

# Findings and Analysis

- **Analyze the Overall Structure of the GitHub Developer Network** :
A subgraph of 100 developers was plotted to visualize developer interactions clearly. The spring layout algorithm was used to improve the graph's interpretability. The GitHub network shows high unevenness,with some developers having many collaborations while others have few or no connections.
![netw 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe21ce1b-f80d-4872-9d3d-c7c02a64873d)

**Insight:** Since the full GitHub network is too large, a smaller sample of 100 developers is visualized to provide a clearer view of individual  connections and relationships.

- **Understand Developer Collaboration Patterns:** 
This visualization represents a subset of the GitHub developer collaboration network. Each node  corresponds to a developer, and the edges represent collaborations between them. The size of each node reflects the developer's connectivity, with larger nodes indicating individuals with more collaborations. This sampled network offers insights into how developers interact, form clusters, and contribute to shared  projects, highlighting the dynamics of collaboration within the GitHub ecosystem.

![netw 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68b0ff44-16a8-42e8-b12c-0a5f0f903518)

**Insight:** This graph shows a subset of GitHub developers and their collaborations. Larger nodes represent developers with more connections,  highlighting key contributors in the network.

- **Degree Centrality (Most Connected Developers):**
Degree centrality measures the number of direct connections a developer has. Developer 31890 is the most  connected, with links to 25% of all users. The top two developers have significantly higher centrality than  others, while the remaining developers still maintain influence but are less central. 
![netw 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2154c82-6e9b-4b95-a2b9-09c882ca3f7f)

**Insight:** The red nodes highlight the top 10 most connected developers in the GitHub network, indicating key influencers
in the GitHub network

  - **Identify Key Bridge Developers Using Betweenness Centrality:** 
Betweenness centrality measures how often a developer appears on the shortest path between others.  Developers with high betweenness centrality act as bridges between different communities, facilitating  collaboration and information flow across the network. Losing these developers could disrupt collaboration  networks.
![netw 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f844f74a-99fe-4de8-83db-01fe5828028d)

**Insight:** The yellow nodes highlight the top 10 developers with the highest betweenness centrality, acting as key bridges in the GitHub network.

- **Analyze the Roles of AI-Assisted vs. Non-AI Developers in the Network:**
A pie chart was generated to visualize the ratio of AI-assisted to non-AI developers. AI-assisted developers (25.8%) had a higher average degree, indicating they collaborated more. Their betweenness centrality was also higher,suggesting they play a crucial role as bridges within the network.
![netw5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74f7dee7-8962-4fac-9251-7a886b67cadc)

**Insight:** AI-Assisted Developers: 9,739 (25.8%) while Non-AI Developers: 27,961 (74.2%)

- **Distribution of Developer connections:**
  The network is sparse, meaning most developers have only a few direct connections, leading to a loosely connected structure A histogram of developer connections (degree distribution) revealed a power-law distribution, where a small number of developers had a vast number of connections, while the majority had very few. This highlights the presence of highly influential developers who act as central hubs, while most developers operate within smaller, isolated clusters.
![netw6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16c02fa8-5f4b-465e-913f-ac6aff8d8cc3)

**Insight:** This decentralized structure suggests that a few key developers significantly impact collaboration, knowledge sharing, and project success acrossthe GitHub network.

- **Examine Community Structures and Developer Subgroups:**
The Louvain community detection algorithm identified 8 distinct communities within the GitHub developer network. Each color in the visualization represents a different community, highlighting how developers naturally cluster based on collaboration patterns. These clusters suggest that developers tend to work within specific subgroups, likely influenced by shared projects, programming languages, or domain expertise.
![netw7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0774c8e7-03c1-430d-a2bc-b0f3e451b9fb)

**Insight:** Understanding these communities can help identify collaboration trends, influential groups, and potential areas for cross-community interaction.
